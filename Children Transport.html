    <h1>Getting young children interested in environmental issues - TRANSPORT</h1>
    <h3>Sun, 21 Apr 2019 20:29:14</h3>

    <h2>Transport</h2>
    Transport is a major contributor to climate change, and the largest air and noise polluter in the UK.  It's important that we understand what the various modes of transport are and
    how they impact the world that we live in.

    <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/790626/2018-provisional-emissions-statistics-report.pdf">DEFRA</a> reported that in 2018, approximately 33% of
    carbon dioxide emissions were from the transport sector.

    <figure class="fig">
      <img class="imageSectionBio" src="images/2019/04/screenshot-2019-04-18-at-13.23.23-e1555590886413.png" alt="" />
      <figcaption class="figCapSection">
        Emissions produced by each sector.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>




    <h4>Cars</h4>
    Every year, illegal levels of nitrogen dioxide are emitted by diesel vehicles, they are responsible for about 71,000 premature deaths in Europe.  
    <h4>Lorries</h4>
    Lorries represent less than 5% of all vehicles on the road in Europe but they are responsible for about a quarter of the transport’s sectors greenhouse gas emissions.
    <h4>Aviation</h4>
    In the last 20 years, emissions  from aviation have more than doubled and is responsible for an estimated 4.9% of man-made global warming.
    <h4>Ships</h4>
    Shipping is the fastest growing source of CO2 and could be responsible for about 17% of global emissions by 2050 if nothing is done. It's also a source of air pollution, acid rain and eutrophication which is a leading
    cause of impairment to many freshwater and coastal marine ecosystems. 
    <h3>Public Transport</h3>
    Public transport can provide a sustainable alternative to car travel.
     <a href="https://www.sustrans.org.uk/what-you-can-do/use-your-car-less/why-use-public-transport">Evidence</a> suggests that public transport has the potential to replace 21% of existing car journeys in cities areas around the UK.  However, due
    to expensive fares, delays and overcrowding, many people are put off by public transport.
    Buses are used more than any other public transport option for local journeys but their use has declined by 11% over the last 10 years,  which is a shame as a full bus can take 50 cars off the
    road!
    Whenever my son and I go to London to visit family and friends for the day, we ditch the car and travel by train, bus and tube.
    <h3>The Great Outdoors</h3>
    <h4>Cycling and scooting</h4>
    Cycling and scooting from a young age has many long-lasting benefits, it develops road awareness and creates good habits for an active adult life. It helps children to connect with nature and helps them get to know
    their local area.  There are many <a href="https://www.sustrans.org.uk/ncn/map/map-and-routes">cycle routes</a> all over the UK that you can use.

    <h4>Walking</h4>
    Since 1995, the number of children walking to school has declined in England and the numbers of  children being driven to primary school has increased each year, walking to school helps reduce
    congestion and <a href="http://theenvironmentalistinme.home.blog/2019/03/28/the-air-we-breathe/">air pollution - a recent study found a link between air pollution and psychosis in children.</a>

    You are more able to explore your local area and get to know your community better by walking. There are many <a href="http://www.walking-routes.co.uk">walking routes</a> in the
    UK.
    <h3>Health Benefits</h3>
    <a href="https://www.bhf.org.uk/news-from-the-bhf/news-archive/2017/april/new-report-assesses-impact-of-physical-inactivity-on-uk-heart-health-and-economy">Research</a> shows that keeping physically active can
    reduce the risk of heart and circulatory disease by as much as 35% and risk of early death by as much as 30%.

    <a href="https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/sites/default/files/lets-get-physical-report.pdf">Studies</a> by the Mental Health Foundation have shown that physical activity can be used to overcome, and even prevent,
    depression and anxiety, and can be as effective as medication and counselling. 

    Young children's gross motor skills begin to develop from birth, and between the ages of 3 and 6 children develop fundamental movement skills, by providing opportunities to develop these skills, they are able to move
    confidently and control body movements.

    By choosing to walk, bike or scoot more often we are reducing our impact on the environment and getting  healthier at the same time.
    <h3>Activity Ideas </h3>
    <p>Walk, scoot or cycle to somewhere with your child at least once a week.

    <h4>Game - Traffic Lights</h4>
    <strong>You'll need the following:</strong>

      <li>Red card</li>
      <li>Orange card</li>
      <li>Green card</li>
    </ul>
    <b>Instructions:</b>

    Cut one circle from the red, orange and green card.

    Show your child the green card and say, "Green light." Explain to your child that they must walk faster without running.

    Show the yellow card and say, "Yellow light." Explain to your child that they must walk slowly as in a slow motion film.

    Show the red card and say, "Red light." Explain to your child that they must stop and remain still, like a statue.

    Alternate the different colours.

    <h4>Discussions</h4>
    Talk about the impact travelling by bus has on the environment.

    Talk about the different types of transport nodes involved in food production such as tractors and ships.

    Talk about the impact that travel has on our environment and health using <a href="http://theenvironmentalistinme.home.blog/2019/03/31/can-young-children-be-interested-in-environmental-issues/">stories</a>
    , poems and making up songs.

    <!-- Other blogs in the series -->
    <h4>Other blogs in the series</h4>
    <p>
      The blogs in this series will have a number of activities that will cover different areas and will hopefully get young children to learn and practice green living habits, gain skills that reflect care and protection of
      the environment as well as learning the impact they have on the environment.
