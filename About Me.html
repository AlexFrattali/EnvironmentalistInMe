  <h1>About me</h1>

  <h3>Sat, 16 Mar 2019 21:36:27 </h3>
  <p>Hey there, let me start by telling you a little bit about myself, my name is Alex and I’m a Chartered Environmentalist.  </p>

  <p>Up until last year I was one of the Directors at a fantastic energy and environmental consultancy, which provides advice to developers in the housing industry.</p>

  <p>I was there for nearly 10 years, but decided to leave to spend more time with my son and husband. </p>


  <p>I still do some freelance work for them, but I'm currently doing a coding course, in hopes of becoming an iOS developer.</p>

  <p>Since leaving the company, I was worried that I was neglecting my environmental side, but by spending more time at home, I was able to see how unsustainable we had become, and I had also become desensitised to the amount of damage we were
    unintentionally doing, mainly because it was happening so gradually.</p>

  <p>For the last 7 years, I had been advising companies on what they should be going, but had forgotten to follow my own advice!</p>

  <p>So at the start of 2019, I decided to reduce my family’s carbon footprint by making small and consistent changes to our lifestyle, I hope something here may inspire you to do the same.</p>
  <p>If you're interested in my qualifications and experience, you can check out my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandra-g-5aa89847/">Linkedin</a> profile.</p>
